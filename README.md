> My name is James and I am most interested in using computers to help build a better world with AI/ML technologies and also stopping AI/ML from making the world worse

### Currently
I am currently a Master of AI student at [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/).

Very interested in AI safey (technical alignment, malignment evaluation), as well as Reinforcement Learning (Neuroevolution is an amazing intersection), Large Language Models.

I am always keen to here about any ideas and projects that involve using Artifical Compute to make the world a better place.

[**CV**](https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/james_thompson_cv/blob/main/output/CV.pdf)

I techincally have a [website](https://1jamesthompson1.github.io/) (that I endeavour to write on more often!).

| ---- | ----------- |
| [TAIC engine](https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/TAIC-report-summary) | Using LLMs and classical NLP methods to scrape and curate a database of identified; safety issues, recommendations etc from various national agencies transport investigations groups. This database is used for analysis as well as powering multiple [smart tools](https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/TAIC_smart_assistant) used internally <br> _Funded by the New Zealand Transport Accident Investigation Commission_
| [Exploring Deep Reinforcement learning for Continuous Robotic control](https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/AIML440_report/blob/main/output/JamesThompsonAIML440Report.pdf) | A project that involved exploring current SOTA methods for training agents to control robots in various simulated environments.<br>_Completed as part of Master of AI_|
| [Getting a LLM to cheat at chess](https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/AIML430_capstone) | A study heavily inspired by reserach from Palisade research. Investigating the when and how various modern LLM cheat (replacing board, using chess engine, etc) when tasked with playing a game of chess.<br>_Completed as part of Master of AI_ |

### Older projects

Some older projects for completeness sake. We can call this the legacy section
