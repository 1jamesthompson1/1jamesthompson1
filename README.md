Hello :wave:

My name is James and I am most interested in using computers to help build a better world with AI/ML technologies.

I graduated from [Massey University](https://www.massey.ac.nz/) at the end of 2023 with a BSc in Computer Science. 

If you have any interesting project in this space that you think I should know about you can contact me at 1jamesthompson1@gmail.com

More updates about my work can be found on my [website](https://1jamesthompson1.github.io/) (that I endeavour to write on more often!).

My **favourite** languages are:
- Rust
- Python
- R
- JS/TS

I also have expereince in:
- C++/C
- Java

Check out some of my repositories (sadly most of my substantive work over the past few years is private due to being for graded projects) below and have a great day!
