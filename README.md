Hello :wave:

My name is James and I am most interested in using computers to help build a better world with AI/ML technologies.

I am currently a Master of AI student at [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/).

If you have any interesting project in this space that you think I should know about you can contact me at 1jamesthompson1@gmail.com

More updates about my work can be found on my [website](https://1jamesthompson1.github.io/) (that I endeavour to write on more often!).

Check out some of my repositories to see some of my work.  
_Note that due to being in university the last few years most of my owrk has to be private as it was for graded assignments._

Some of my recent projects include:
- Using LLMs to read transport accident investigation reports. https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/TAIC-report-summary
- Developing a complete booking and invoive system for a music school. https://github.com/The-Rock-Academy
- Working on and expanding an R statistic package to make it more accessible to vision impaired users. https://github.com/ajrgodfrey/BrailleR


Have a great day!
